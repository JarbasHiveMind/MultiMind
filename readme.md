# MultiMind

initiates a ovos-core instance per access key, each key gets a unique isolated "Mind"  (multiple connection with same key allowed)

can be used in a cloud context to provide a dedicated assistant per account, replaces the standard hivemind listener

currently just a proof of concept, stay tuned
